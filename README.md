### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Most of my uploaded codes are from my learning journey e.g. book exercises and university assignments - so there's not much to showcase yet. <br>

However I do either have some foundational knowledge and/or deep interest in collaborating (or working) on projects involving:
- Game design & development
  - especially if (but not limited to) using Unity3D, C#, JavaScript, or C++
- Web development
  - particularly Full-Stack or Single-Page Applications
  - especially if (but not limited to) using TypeScript, NPM, or Deno.js
