                     NOTE

  There isn't much to see here yet, but I have
  made public my source code outputs from some
  book exercises and student assignments I did
  (mixed with personal notes; pardon the mess)
  
  When I do have something worth showing, they
  would be among the other pinned repositories
  
   In the mean time, feel free to look around
   to get to know either what I've been up to
     ...or my current interests ...or both.
